These codes are based on the book:

Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming

writed by Eric Matthes.

The codes contain the examples and the practices in the book,
which are only used for my personal study of python and git.

Of course, I will appreciate it if anyone would be kind enough to guide me.
